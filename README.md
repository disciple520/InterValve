My first ever coding project - an iOS Marketing Application. I built most of this, then it was polished by the developer who enlisted my help. 

This repo contains only the source code and some demo screenshots.

The application is quite simple. There are a number of buttons on the Splash Screen. They all direct to separate views that contain one of the following: A pdf brochure, an embedded video, or an image with a slider to show animation. Each view also has a link back to the home screen. Take a look!
